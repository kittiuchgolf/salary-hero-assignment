# Salary Hero Automation

This project uses Playwright for end-to-end browser automation tests against https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com/#/.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Run all Playwright tests:
   ```sh
   npx playwright test
   ```
3. To run a specific test file:
   ```sh
   npx playwright test tests/juice-shop.spec.js
   ```

## Test Scenarios

- Login, add 1 item to basket, checkout, add address
- Login, add 2 items to basket, checkout, add address
- Search for "apple", verify 2 apple products and no banana product

## Project Structure

- `tests/juice-shop.spec.js`: Main test scenarios for Juice Shop
- `playwright.config.js`: Playwright configuration

## Notes

- If login fails, ensure the test user exists or update the test to register a new user.
- For selector issues, use Playwright Inspector or Codegen for robust selectors.
